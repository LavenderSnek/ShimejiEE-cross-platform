ShimejiEE Cross Platform
========================

https://github.com/LavenderSnek/ShimejiEE-cross-platform

The releases aren't updated frequently, so build it from source for the latest release.

This project is a fork of [Kilkakon's shimeji version](http://kilkakon.com/shimeji) and incorporates the work from [nonowarn's shimeji4mac](https://github.com/nonowarn/shimeji4mac)

Installation
-------

- macOS:
  - Download the `mac-jre` version
  - Click the file named `ShimejiEE-launcher`. 
  - If the OS doesn't let you open it because it's from an unidentified developer: 
    - Go to System preferences → Security & privacy → General, and make sure `App Store and Identified developers` is selected in the "Allow apps downloaded from:" section
    - Restart you computer, just to be safe
    - Now right-click the launcher and click open. Ignore the warnings. 
  - If it still doesn't work, try re-downloading it directly from the GitHub releases page and make sure to unzip with Archiver.app

- Linux:
  - First consider trying out [linux-shimeji](https://github.com/asdfman/linux-shimeji), it has x11 support
  - Download the `no-jre` version. 
  - Still a WIP with lots of issues, but you can use java 17 to launch `ShimejiEE.jar`. 
  - Install java from a different vendor if `libawt_xawt.so` is missing. 
  - All program files are lowercase by default but Image-sets might break due to case sensitivity.

- Windows:
  - Download the `no-jre` version. 
  - Untested but you can try it out; Just make sure to use java 17.
