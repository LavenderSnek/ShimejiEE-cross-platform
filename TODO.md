# Todo

## Immediate
- Non-rectangular window on mac
- Scaling
  - move hqx to image pair loader
- Test actions and sounds
- Start writing xml documentation
- Linux
  - Fails, but seems unrelated to the Shimeji code
    - Missing `libawt_xawt.so`
    - Error on `UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());`
  - Try different jdk download
  - Try more distros and DEs
- Keyboard shortcuts
- The flickering
  - The shimeji just go transparent sometimes
  - No idea how to fix it, it doesn't happen consistently

## Distant
- Possibly try JNI to replace some JNA code for performance
- ChromeOS/Android
